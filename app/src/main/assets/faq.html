<h3>Limitations:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
CGO is not available to because it relies on gcc. I may support it in the future by using an Android port of gcc.
</li>
<li>
Same goes for Go Get since it requires multiple version control systems to be already installed on the machine.
</li>
<li>
Everything is stored in internal memory for convenience because binaries can't run on the SD card.
</li>
<li>
Manipulating the I/O streams directly does not work because current Android versions do not support I/O redirection.
</li>
